      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>It has only been in the last century that the technology has been developed to allow in-depth research of these electroceramics, and as such, to-date they are relatively unexplored. And because of this, researchers are developing new materials, applications, and processing methods of materials all the time. However, in my mind, what is even more fascinating than these amazing breakthroughs are the mechanics and fundamentals behind them. </p>
      <p>This fascination has been with me all my life as I have always been captivated by the question “Why does it work?” When I was first introduced to the Materials Engineering Department, it was during a presentation done by one of the faculty members on the different aspects of materials in our lives. The professor performed various demonstrations such as breaking a piece of material by merely applying a slight amount of pressure to a certain location on it, and placing a rubber ball into liquid nitrogen and then shattering the ball against a wall. As soon as the demonstration was over, I knew that Materials Engineering was for me, as I was driven by my need to discover why the professor was able to do everything he was in the said demonstration.</p>
      <p>Of particular interest to me are electroceramics, especially glass ceramics in this category, with regards to their dielectric, photoelectric, and pyroelectric properties. From semiconductors to imaging devices, the current and potential range of applications of these materials is enormous. As our technology advances and more sophisticated electronic equipment are developed, scientists/researchers are beginning to understand and appreciate the importance of electroceramics and other materials. They are also realizing that in order to continue and improve our technology, more research is needed in order to develop the novel materials that are required to create the devices that they envision.</p>
